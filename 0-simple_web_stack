1.What is a server?

    In the context of a web infrastructure, a server refers to a physical or virtual machine that provides services and resources to other computers (clients).
    Servers can host websites, applications, databases, or any other service that clients can access over a network.
    They receive and process requests from clients, deliver responses, and store or process data.

2.What is the role of the domain name?

    A domain name serves as a human-readable address for a website or any other online service.
    It provides a memorable and meaningful way for users to access websites rather than relying on numeric IP addresses.
    When a user enters a domain name (e.g., www.foobar.com) in their browser, it is used to locate the corresponding server's IP address.

3.What type of DNS record is "www" in "www.foobar.com"?

    The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a subdomain of the domain name.
    It is commonly used to identify a specific service or resource within a domain.
    In terms of DNS records, the "www" subdomain is typically represented by a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the main domain or an A (Address) record that directly maps the subdomain to an IP address.

4.What is the role of the web server?

    The web server plays a crucial role in delivering web content to clients (user's computers) over the Internet.
    It receives and processes HTTP or HTTPS requests from clients.
    The web server is responsible for serving static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images) and may also handle URL routing and redirection.
    It can interact with application servers, pass requests to them for dynamic content generation, and receive the responses to deliver back to clients.

5.What is the role of the application server?

    The application server is responsible for executing the dynamic code and application logic of a website or web application.
    It processes requests that require dynamic content generation, such as user authentication, database interactions, and complex business logic.
    The application server communicates with databases, external services, or other resources as needed.
    It generates responses based on the request and application-specific logic, which are then passed back to the web server for delivery to clients.

6.What is the role of the database?

    The database stores and manages structured data used by web applications.
    It provides a persistent and organized way to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.
    Web applications often use databases to store user information, content, configuration data, or any other data required by the application.
    The database server manages the data, handles queries and transactions, and provides an interface for the application server to interact with the data.

7.What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?

    The server communicates with the computer of the user requesting the website over the Internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols.
    HTTP/HTTPS is the protocol used for transmitting hypertext, links, and other resources on the World Wide Web.
    The server listens for HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user's computer, processes them, and sends back HTTP/HTTPS responses containing the requested content.

#Issues with this infrastructure:

1.Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

    Since there is only one server, any failure or downtime of that server will result in the website becoming inaccessible.
    Hardware failure, network issues, or software problems on the server can cause complete service disruption.

2.Downtime during Maintenance:

    When performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updating software, the web server needs to be restarted.
    During the restart process, the website may be temporarily unavailable, resulting in downtime for users.

3.Limited Scalability:

    With only one server, the infrastructure has limited capacity to handle high traffic or sudden spikes in user demand.
    As the website grows and attracts more visitors, the server may become overwhelmed, leading to performance issues.
