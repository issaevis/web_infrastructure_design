1.Firewalls:

    Firewalls are added to enhance security in the infrastructure.
    Firewalls act as a barrier between the servers and external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    They monitor and filter network packets, allowing authorized traffic and blocking unauthorized or malicious connections.
    Firewalls help protect against various threats such as unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, and intrusion attempts.

2.Traffic Served over HTTPS:

    Traffic is served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication between the user's computer and the servers.
    HTTPS uses encryption to protect sensitive data transmitted over the network, such as login credentials or personal information.
    It prevents eavesdropping, data tampering, and unauthorized access to user data.
    By enabling HTTPS, the infrastructure ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between the user and the servers.

3.Monitoring:

    Monitoring is used to ensure the health, performance, and availability of the servers and infrastructure components.
    It helps identify and address issues proactively, minimizing downtime and optimizing performance.
    Monitoring provides insights into resource utilization, system metrics, application performance, and user experience.
    It helps detect anomalies, troubleshoot problems, and ensure that the infrastructure is operating within defined performance thresholds.

4.Data Collection by Monitoring Tools:

    Monitoring tools collect data from servers and infrastructure components through various methods:
    Agent-based monitoring: Agents are installed on the servers to collect and transmit data to the monitoring tool.
    API-based monitoring: Monitoring tools interact with server APIs to retrieve metrics and data.
    Log-based monitoring: Log files from servers are parsed and analyzed to extract relevant information.
    The collected data includes metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, response times, error rates, and more.
    Monitoring tools store and analyze the collected data, generate reports, and trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds.

5.Monitoring Web Server QPS:

    To monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), you can use monitoring tools that provide metrics specific to web server performance.
    Configure the monitoring tool to collect request and response data from the web server.
    Monitor metrics such as request count, response time, and error rate.
    Set up alerts or notifications based on predefined thresholds for QPS to get notified of any anomalies or performance issues.

#Issues with the infrastructure:

1.Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

    Terminating SSL at the load balancer level means decrypting SSL traffic at the load balancer before forwarding it to the servers.
    This can be an issue if there is sensitive data transmitted between the load balancer and the servers.
    It introduces an additional security risk, as the decrypted traffic within the infrastructure is susceptible to potential attacks or interception.

2.Having Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:

    Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure.
    If the MySQL server fails, write operations cannot be performed, impacting data updates and modifications.
    It also limits scalability, as a single server may not handle high write loads or accommodate future growth.

3.Servers with All the Same Components (Database, Web Server, and Application Server):

    Having servers with all the same components can lead to resource constraints and inefficient resource allocation.
    If resource demands vary between components, it becomes challenging to optimize resource allocation and scale resources independently.
    It can limit flexibility in scaling different components based on their specific requirements and workload patterns.
