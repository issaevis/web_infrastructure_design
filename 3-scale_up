1.Additional Server:

    An additional server is added to the infrastructure to split the components into their own dedicated servers.
    This separation allows each component (web server, application server, database) to have its dedicated resources and optimize their performance independently.
    It also provides better scalability and fault tolerance by distributing the load across multiple servers.

2.Load Balancer Cluster:

    The load balancer (HAproxy) is configured as a cluster with multiple load balancer nodes.
    The load balancer cluster provides high availability and improves the scalability of the infrastructure.
    If one load balancer node fails, the other nodes can handle the incoming traffic and ensure continuous operation.

3.Split Components with Dedicated Servers:

    The web server, application server, and database are split into separate dedicated servers.
    Splitting the components into dedicated servers allows each component to utilize dedicated resources and optimize performance.
    It enables scaling each component independently based on its specific requirements and workload patterns.
    The separation of components also enhances fault isolation, making troubleshooting and maintenance easier.
